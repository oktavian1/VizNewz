# Description
VizNewz is a news sentiment analysis app, originally made for the Jakarta Regency Government as a part of the Jakarta Smart City (JSC). We aim to assist the government and its citizens to get the latest trends from the city.
In addition to that, users can also look at sentiment analysis (from positive, negative, and neutral) in the form of bar chart and line chart. Visualization will minimize the expected time to analyze news report at maximum speed.
With VizNewz, we want the government to see that there are plenty of far more important issues that need to be taken care of, especially the negative ones, which demands immediate and helpful solution from the government.
